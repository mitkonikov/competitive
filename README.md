# Competitive Programming Problems and Solutions

![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Solutions&message=1499&color=brightgreen)

This repository is meant as a public place to store my competitive programming solutions to various competitive programming problems on sites such as:
 - [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
 - [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
 - [Kattis](http://open.kattis.com/)
 - [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)
 - [CodeFu](https://codefu.mk/)
 - [COCI](https://hsin.hr/coci/)
 - [Slovenian ACM](https://putka-upm.acm.si/)
 - [Macedonian Mendo](https://mendo.mk/)
 - [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/)
 - and more...

The problems are divided into separate categories according to what algorithms or data structures are used in the solution. The purpose of this repository is to help beginners if they are stuck with some problem.

### Disclaimer

Some of the solutions contain code of certain algorithms that may have been copied from different places.

## Frequently Asked Questions

 - What extension do you use to judge the problems?
    - [CPH Judge](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) for VSCode combined with [Competitive Companion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/competitive-companion/cjnmckjndlpiamhfimnnjmnckgghkjbl?pli=1) on Google Chrome.
 - What font do you use?
    - [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code).
 - What languages do you code in?
    - Mostly C++, but I use Python when I have to deal with heavy string parsing.
 - What compiler do you use?
    - MinGW G++ (C++17 standard)
 - Do you teach for money?
    - Sorry, no. Although I sometimes work with Olympiad contestants in my home country, I'm currently working as a research and development engineer.
 - What is your biggest advice for novice competitive programmers?
    - Consistency >> Intensity. Solving every day something is much better than solving a lot of problems only once in a while.
 - Where do you study?
    - [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://feri.um.si/), University of Maribor, Slovenia.
 - Where are you from?
    - Strumica, Republic of Macedonia.


## My Own Problem Sets

### FERI Round #1

This round was created to motivate students to engage in competitive programming and therefore, the problems are quite easy. Nonetheless, all of the problems are incredibly fun and educational, so everyone can learn something from them. The whole problem set is original and written by me.

You can solve the round [here](https://codeforces.com/contestInvitation/47ae8382a534ff7e8bf220bd0122f4bfcbf9dabd).

 > Note that the problems are given in Slovene, but there is also a .PDF file in the "Contest Material" section containing the statements in English.
